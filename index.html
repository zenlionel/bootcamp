           I grew up in Costa Rica, lived there for 20 years. While in school I learned German, Spanish and English. 
           I also took French outside of school. My parents were avid tennis players, through them I started playing almost everyday. 
           Thanks to this commitment to tennis I was able to play across latin-america and Europe.

            I went to college in Colorado, there I majored in History and all my electives were in Physics and Math. 
            After Graduating I worked for Colorado College in the IT department. There I did tech-suport and innovative technology.
            The best projects I ran were the Virtual Reality Expo and the Gaming on Campus events, these were often co-run with the Mental Health team.
